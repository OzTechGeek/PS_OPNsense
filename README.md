# OPNsense

## About
This is a PowerShell module that leverages the OPNsense api to manage an [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) open source firewall appliances. The development of both OPNsense and this PowerShell module is still very much ongoing, so additional functionality will be added as these projects mature.

## Supported Modules
Currently there are api hooks for these OPNsense modules:
- **CaptivePortal**
- **Core (Firmware and Packages)**
- **Cron**
- **Diagnostics**
- **IDS**
- **Proxy**
- Routes
- TrafficShaper
- Unbound

Modules in **bold** have mostly been implemented in the current version of the PS_OPNsense module.

## Examples
```powershell
Connect-OPNsense -Uri 'https://fw01.local/api' -Key <my_api_key> -Secret <my_api_secret>
Get-OPNsense
Restart-OPNsense
Disconnect-OPNsense
```
